### Software Flow

- Sensor(s) Triggered
`Read and store sensor values from the five pins`
- Threshold Validation
`Filter out all sensors below the threshold value`
- Store the filtered sensor readings

### Global Variables

- Number of pins = 5
- Threshold = (verify via testing)
- Initial_Force_readings => There will be an initial sensor reading that needs to be excluded during calculations
